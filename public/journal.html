    I played Yakuza for almost 5 hours. I finally finished the boss from chapter 12 thank god. I am over 70h into the
    game and üôè I am hoping to finish it before I go into 100 lol. But I kinda want to 100% and get all achievement it
    seems feasible. The racing games feel a bit difficult because I suck ass at racing games over all but maybe playing
    yakuza: like a dragon will make me better at all games.
    <br />
    I don't see myself playing another Yakuza game any time soon after finishing this one because it's quite mental and
    time-consuming, but I am addicted enough where I feel like I should finish it 100% for sure.

    I finished Yakuza yesterday, I cried a bit and loved it. I would love to play the other ones, but I feel like they
    may take my soul, so I am scared of giving up my soul to the yakuza lords.
    <br />
    I started work again it's being nice to getting back into my routine and stuff. I am also trying to stop watching
    youtube as much, so I move to use invidious instead and no longer paying for premium. Saving money but also
    motivation to stop using the fucking app. I'll go to the app more intentionally.

    I went to the office yesterday for a bit for cake and stuff. My legs are still a bit purple but not in pain anymore.
    I can go to the gym and i am enjoying having an kind active life again.
    <br />
    I am playing NieR:Automata‚Ñ¢ and it's feel a bit boring for me. Too big to slow and fast at the same time. I think, i
    got this game almost 4 years ago because Diego Johhson recommended it to me. Idk I think I would enjoy it more in a
    PC with something playing in a second monitor lol. I think it doesn't fit my style of game or maybe it will get
    better later. I didn't love yakuza at the beggingin but at the end i loved it. i would say it was a 7/10 it got a
    bit painful at the end.
    <br />
    I've been listening to audiobooks lately, writing some reviews on goodreads. I've been limiting my youtube
    consumption by a lot lately. I found myself instinctively grabbing my phone and looking for the youtube app. At the
    beginning it was difficult but now I am getting better i think.
    <br />
    I'll try to add some design or get some fun ideas to make this site a bit more lively. We'll see.

    I finished Kraken Academy and started playing Dredge. Kraken Academy was a bit boring but I didn't mind it. I was a
    bit boring looking but I enjoyed the concept and the simplicity and I might go back to it just to 100% it.
    <br />
    My manager recommended me Dredge yesterday and I bought it and started playing it last night and loved it so much.
    It has a Dave the diver vibe but a bit more crepy and so far it's pretty cool. It has a scary kinda crepy vibe I am
    loving very much.
    <br />
    I also started two books <b>The midnight library</b> and <b>The ocean at the end of the lane</b>. I find the first
    one interesting so far, a bit sad but it's not an audiobook so my attention span will be tested this weekend but the
    other one it's amazing so far it just need a strong end but so far it's 5 stars for me. I am loving Neil Gaiman
    writing style and I will love to read more of his books once I am done with this one. I actually would like to dive
    into longer books I feel like I am enjoying my me time more and more lately.
    <br />
    I've stopped my youtube premium subscription, uninstalled the app from my phone, paused my history tracking (to make
    my alo) and I can see how much less time I'm expending on it overall and I'm really happy about it. I prefer
    listening to audiobooks or playing video games, reading some papers or just doing other things for entertainment I
    feel more engage this way.
    <br />
    OHHH I've also started watching a really cute K-Drama on netflix <b>love next door</b> it's cozy and corny in all
    the perfect ways.
