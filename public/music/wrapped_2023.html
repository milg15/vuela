    <h1>Spotify Wrapped 2023 [WIP]</h1>

    <div>
        <p>
            I know it's almost the end of 2024 but I just wanted to over-analyze my Spotify Wrapped 2023. I've extremely
            emotionally disconnected with most of this songs now but I remember vividly the emotional state I was in
            when those song where all I could listen to. I'm not sure if I should be proud or ashamed of the amount of
            time I spent listening to these songs.
            <br>
            <br>
            A bit of context so you can understand my emotional state better: Around november of 2022 I moved to a
            different continent without knowing anyone in this new city at all, right as the year ended I've also found
            out my ex (who was my friend at that time) and then best friend had started dating behind my back. After
            that they both blocked me on every possible social media site... So yeah, I was a bit of a mess. It was my
            first time living on my own and I felt extremely lonely and betrayed. I remember listening to these songs on
            repeat while I was trying to make sense what had happened and how I was going to move on from it.
            <br>
            <br>
            I also started running last year because I was such an emotional mess and I needed to do something to keep
            my mind off things. I also went out to party a lot, so I was listening to a lot of music. ANYWAYS, here are
            the songs I listened to the most in 2023, you'll see I was in a very specific mood.
            <br>
            <br>
            Thanks to <a href="https://americasdecline.neocities.org/music/wrapped23">this site</a> for the inspo. I've
            always wanted to do something like this but actually someone write about it in this way made so much sense
            to me. The music we listen in a certain time can be a good indicator of our emotional state and it's super
            interesting to see how this changes over time.

                    I clearly remember listening to this song and watching the video the day it came out (Jan, 13),
                    two days before my birthday. I did get myself flowers for my birthday and threw the entire year
                    I was trying to remind myself that things end for a reason and that things don't always go as
                    expected and that's okay. Also, if Miley went through a divorce and is happier afterwards I can
                    do it.
                    Even thought I have some plays in this song I think after march I stopped listening to it was
                    too much and corny for me lol. I am happy for Miley tho. She got her first grammy for this song.
                    You'll see other songs throughout this list that follow a similar theme of healing oneself and
                    moving on.

                <p class="music-description">
                    I mean... this one is quite self-explanatory. I felt so betrayed by my ex and my friend that I
                    was so upset I would change the lyrics of this song for the name of this person lol. Shakira was
                    cheated and then drops this banger. Reminding me how much I've accomplish just on my own and
                    that I shouldn't settle for someone how isn't willing to give me the same energy I give them.
                    <br>
                    Second song from a women going through a divorce lol.

                <h3>3. "Blind and Frozen" by Beast in Black</h3>
                <p class="music-subtitle">Scrobbles: 136</p>
                <p class="music-description">
                    I've never been into metal but I was so angry and frustrated that I needed to listen to music
                    that matched my energy plus this type or music where perfect for running. This style of metal is
                    quite melodic and I can sing to it so that may it easier to get into for my very poppy music
                    background. Even thought it's a metal song I think the themes of this one are a bit happier than
                    you would expect.

                <p class="music-description">
                    This is another song about healing and moving on ... I know, I know, around the time this song
                    came out I was thinking maybe I am ready to date again. I enjoyed this one a lot.

                <p class="music-description">
                    Another running song lol. I was running a lot last year. I was trying to get my mind off things
                    I cried once listening to it, it was somewhere around mid year beacuse I was starting to feel
                    happy and like myself again. I was adapting to my new life and I was starting to feel like I've
                    made the right decision by moving here.

                <p class="music-subtitle">Scrobbles: 95</p>
                <blockquote>
                    You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard? You can't love anyone 'cause that would
                    mean you had a heart.
                </blockquote>
                <p class="music-description">
                    I went to see her live this year but I got the tickets last year so I was listening to her a
                    lot. This another betrayal related ... jesus christ I was so dramatic last year. I still enjoy
                    this song but not to the emotional extent I did last year. All this song kept me company while
                    and made me feel like I wasn't alone. I am not the only one who has gone through this and I will
                    not be the last.

                <h3>7. "Fear of Dying" by Poppy</h3>
                <p class="music-subtitle">Scrobbles: 85</p>
                <p>
                    Another metal but not really metal song. It's metal for people who don't like metal. It's the right
                    level of angry but I can still understand their words.

                <p class="music-description">
                    I moved to Denmark and I was trying to learn danish. This became one of my favorite song of the year
                    and I even went to see them live. My learning Danish journey is still not going great but I am
                    trying. I'll be re-starting again next month. Maybe this time around I'll be able to understand the
                    lyrics of this song.
