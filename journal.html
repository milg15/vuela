      I played yakuza for almost 5 hours. I finally finished the boss sfrom chapter 12 thank god. I am over 70h into the game and üôè I am hoping to finish it before I go into 100 lol. But I kinda want to 100% and get all achievement it seems feasible. The racing games seems a bit difficult because I suck ass at racing games over all but maybe playing yakuza: like a dragon will make me better at all games.
      <br/>
      I don't see myself playing another Yakuza game any time soon after finishing this one because it's quite mental and time consuming but I am addinted enought where I feel like I should finish it 100% for sure.

      I finished Yakuza yesterday, I cried a bit and loved it. I would love to play the other ones but I feel like they may take my soul so I am scared of giving up my soul to the yazukza lords.

      I started work again it's being nice to getting back into my routine and stuff. I am also trying to stop watching youtube as much, so I move to use invidius instead and no longer paying for premiun. Saving money but also motivation to stop using the fucking app. I'll go to the app more intentionally.

        I went to the office yesterday for a bit for cake and stuff. My legs are still a bit purple but not in pain anymore. I can go to the gym and i am enjoying having an kind active life again.

        I am playing NieR:Automata‚Ñ¢ and it's feel a bit boring for me. Too big to slow and fast at the same time. I think, i got this game almost 4 years ago because Diego Johhson recomended it to me. Idk I think I would enjoy it more in a PC with something playing in a second monitor lol. I think it doesn't  fit my style of game or maybe it will get better later. I didn't love yakuza at the beggingin but at the end i loved it. i would say it was a 7/10 it got a bit painful at the end.

        I've been listening to audiobooks lately, writting some reviews on goodreads. I've been limiting my youtube consmption by a lot lately. I found myself instintively grabbing my phone and looking for the youtube app. At the beggining it was difficult but now I am getting better i think.
        <br/>
        I'll try to add some design or get some fun ideas to make this site a bit more lively. We'll see.
