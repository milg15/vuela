    <p>
        I played yakuza for almost 5 hours. I finally finished the boss sfrom chapter 12 thank god. I am over 70h into
        the game and üôè I am hoping to finish it before I go into 100 lol. But I kinda want to 100% and get all
        achievement it seems feasible. The racing games seems a bit difficult because I suck ass at racing games over
        all but maybe playing yakuza: like a dragon will make me better at all games.
        <br />
        I don't see myself playing another Yakuza game any time soon after finishing this one because it's quite mental
        and time consuming but I am addinted enought where I feel like I should finish it 100% for sure.
